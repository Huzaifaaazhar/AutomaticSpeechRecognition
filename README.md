# Automatic Speech Recognition System

The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) System is designed to convert spoken language into written text using advanced machine learning models and algorithms. This project is structured into a backend and a frontend component, providing a complete solution for speech-to-text conversion.

The backend of the system, implemented in Python, includes various modules responsible for data handling, model management, and API services. The frontend is developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, offering a user-friendly interface to interact with the speech recognition functionalities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.12 or newer**: Required for the backend services.
- **Node.js**: Necessary for managing frontend dependencies and running the frontend application.

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Begin by cloning the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automatic-speech-recognition-system.git
   cd automatic-speech-recognition-system
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   It is a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment as follows:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Python Packages**

   Install the necessary Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

   Change directory to where the frontend code is located:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Packages**

   Install the Node.js packages required for the frontend application:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Backend

To start the backend server, run:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch the backend service, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. The backend handles the core functionality of speech recognition, including model inference and API endpoints.

### Running the Frontend

For the frontend, first navigate to the `frontend` directory if you are not already there:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Then, start the frontend server with:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. This interface allows users to upload audio files, interact with the speech recognition service, and view transcribed text.

## Deployment

### Deploying on Vercel

To deploy the project on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Vercel**

   Use the Vercel CLI to log in to your Vercel account:

   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Deploy the Project**

   Deploy your project using the Vercel CLI:

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

This will deploy both the frontend and backend components to Vercel. Make sure to configure your deployment settings according to your projectâ€™s requirements.

### Docker Deployment

If you prefer using Docker for deployment, you can build and run the Docker containers with the provided `docker-compose.yml` file:

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This setup ensures that all the necessary services are containerized and can be easily managed and deployed.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configuration for the application is managed through environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

```ini
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
```

Replace `your_secret_key` and `your_database_url` with your actual secret key and database URL. These variables are critical for the backend's operation, ensuring secure and proper configuration.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are highly encouraged. To contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Create a personal copy of the repository by forking it on GitHub.

2. **Create a New Branch**

   Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**

   Implement the desired changes or features.

4. **Commit Your Changes**

   Commit your modifications with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Add new feature or fix bug'
   ```

5. **Push Your Changes**

   Push the changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**

   Submit a pull request to the original repository, describing your changes and the purpose of the contribution.
